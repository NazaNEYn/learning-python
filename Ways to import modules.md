## Ways to import modules:

1. **`import`** <br>
 First we have to import the module by using the `import` keyword and the module name. <br>

For example:
`import random`
or
`import turtle`

### Now how to use it:

Example:
```
turtle = turtle.Turtle()
```

```python
turtle.Turtle()
# turtle is the module name
#and
# Turtle() is the name of the class
```

2. **`from...import..`**<br>


```python
from turtle import Turtle
# from is the keyword
# turtle is the module name
# import is the keyword
# Turtle the class name

turtle = Turtle()
```

3. **Importing everything:**<br>

`from turtle import *`

The asterisk (`*`) will let you import everything from the module.<br>

*NOTE:* It's not a good practice to use this type of importing.

----------------------------------------------
## Aliasing Modules:

Example:

```python
import turtle as t
```

`turtle = t.Turtle()`

*NOTE:* This is useful for when the module name is really long.

| **Mean (Average)** | Sum of all values divided by the count. | When data is evenly distributed and you need a precise average. |
| **Median (Middle Value)** | The middle value after ordering the data. | When data has **outliers** (extreme values) that would skew the mean. |
| **Mode (Most Frequent)** | The value that appears most often in the data set. | When you want to know the most common item or category. |
